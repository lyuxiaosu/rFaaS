1.closeloop_exp_warm_multi_func_wrapper.sh vs closeloop_exp_multi_func_wrapper.sh: motivition test to show rfaas has longer latency then sledge. This test uses fib(1) and fib(32) to test
2. measure_throughput.sh to measure throughput scaling with cores for rfaas and sledge
3. measure_function_density_with_32types.sh to measure function density that less than 64 types. Sledge uses measure_function_density.sh to measure function density.
   For middleware Sledge, comment worker preallocate sandbox in worker_thread.c and not use sandbox lifecycle management.
   Make sure the worker is pinned to the same core in rFaaS, middleware Sledge and EdgeScale. The default test setup pin the worker thread to core 4
